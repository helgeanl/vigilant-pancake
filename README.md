#### Disclaimer
The project is released as is. Including temporary code, bad code, bugs, and headaches from reading non-commmented code.

One Known bug is that when we print the last 3 digits of the IP to the console, it crashes if the IP of the computer you are on is below x.x.x.100, quickfix is to check for this and simply append a 0.
